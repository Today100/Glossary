# Multi-tools/Glossory
A program build for practice python and tkinter

## About the whole project.

The program is previously work as a contact book. However, my intention changed and want to make the program more useful and better. Therefore, now there is two version of the program I am creating.

### Program one: Glossory

Glossory is an enhanced program of the contact book. It is a program that you could create database and save information into it. 

It includes two file, "trial1_1.py" is the GUI(graphic user interface) and "trial1.py" which stores the sql functions.

### Program two: Multi-tools

Multi-tools is a program includes many other tools such as a drawing board, a notebook calculator, a image to base64 transformer, a note editor. 

Some other tools are also in developing such as a todo-list, login program, a cypher and dcypher program, journal program, etc.

The glossory program will soon be added into this Multi-tools program.

The two main file of this program are "trial1_2.py", it includes the GUI and the tools used for the program, and "trial12.py", a copy of "trial1.py" that is specifically used for this program (Since I haven't combined the glossory program with the Multi-tools yet, because I have to recreate all the GUI, "trial12.py" is currently not necessary.). 

### The "Tools main file" folder:

The tools main file folder includes all the tools I am creating or created for the Multi-tools program. It works as a rough draft or testing place for the tools before I put them into the Multi-tools program.

**In the finish folder:**
  1. b_a_se folder:
      
      A image to base64 converter.
      
  3. bot folder:

  5. Cal folder:
