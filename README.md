# Multi-tools/Glossary
A program built for practice python and Tkinter

## About the whole project.

The program is previously working as a contact book. However, my intention changed and want to make the program more useful and better. Therefore, now there are two versions of the program I am creating.

### Program one: Glossory

Glossary is an enhanced program of the contact book. It is a program that you could create a database and save informations into it. I create it and named it Glossary because I intend to use it to store vocabulary and memorize them.

It includes two files, "trial1_1.py" is the GUI(graphic user interface) and "trial1.py" which stores the SQL functions.

### Program two: Multi-tools

Multi-tools is a program that includes many other tools such as a drawing board, a notebook calculator, an image to base64 converter, and a note editor. 

Some other tools are also developing such as a todo-list, login program, a cypher and decipher program, journal program, etc.

The glossary program will soon be added to this Multi-tools program.

The two main files of this program are "trial1_2.py", which includes the GUI and the tools used for the program, and "trial12.py", a copy of "trial1.py" that is specifically used for this program (Since I haven't combined the glossary program with the Multi-tools yet, because I have to recreate all the GUI, "trial12.py" is currently not necessary.). 

### The "Tools main file" folder:

The tools main file folder includes all the tools I am creating or have created for the Multi-tools program. It works as a rough draft or testing place for the tools before I put them into the Multi-tools program.

**In the finish folder:**
  1. b_a_se folder:
      
      An image to base64 converter.
    
  2. Cal folder:
  
      A notebook calculator. You type the equation on the left side column and the result can be displayed in the right-side column.
      
      It supports variables but does not work really well.
  
  3. drbo folder:

      A drawing board.

  4. note folder:

      A note editor that does not work really well but it works.


**In the pending folder:**
  1. bot folder:

      Trying to create a machine learning bot.
      
  2. cypher decypher folder:
      
      A cypher and decypher program. I have built all the functions, and now need to create a GUI for it to work.
      
  3. journal folder:

      Tring to create a journal program.

  4. login folder:

      Trying to create a login program. I have built the functions, and now need a GUI.

  5. tdlish folder:

      Trying to create a to-do list program. Halfway done.
